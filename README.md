## Clean Code

This website is at <https://github.com/vijaynathani/CleanCodeMar>

All slides, exercises, and course material will be kept in this repository during the training.
This repository will be deleted one week after the training is over.

Any participant can [email](mailto:vijay_nathani@yahoo.com) the trainer for any issues.

Please give your [feedback](https://forms.office.com/r/qyhmFSkRUj) at the end of training. Then, give this [objective test](https://forms.office.com/r/NzZVsf0nf7). Lastly, refactor the project MovieRefactoring and email your solution to Trainer before EOD.
